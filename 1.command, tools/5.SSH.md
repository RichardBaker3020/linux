SSH
---
SSH 分为客户端和服务端。  
服务端是一个守护进程，一般是 *sshd* 进程，在后台运行并响应来自客户端的请求。提供了对远程请求的处理，一般包括公共密钥认证、密钥交换、对称密钥加密和非安全连接。 客户端一般是 *ssh* 进程，另外还包含 scp、slogin、sftp 等其他进程。

### ssh server
Install ssh server: `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`

开启 sshd：
```
$ systemctl start sshd.service 
$ systemctl stop sshd.service
$ systemctl restart sshd.service
```

sshd cinfiguration file：`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
``` 
Port 22    // default is 22

RSAAuthentication yes 
pubkeyAuthentication yes

AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys

PasswordAuthentication no        // whether allow connection with password
```

The `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file lets the server authenticate the user, this file is used for ssh server 

### How Does SSH Work
An SSH session is established in *two separate stages*.  
1. The first is to agree upon and establish encryption to protect future communication.  
2. The second stage is to authenticate the user and discover whether access to the server should be granted.

**First stage: Authenticating the Server, Negotiating Encryption for the Session**  
FIrst of all, when a TCP connection is made by a client, the server responds with the protocol versions it supports. __The server provides its public host key__, which the client can use to check whether this was the intended host. It proves to the client that it knows the associated private key by public-key cryptography. This authenticates the server: if this part of the protocol is successful, the client knows that the server is who it claims it is.

SSH provides only a simple mechanism to verify the server's legitimacy: it remembers servers you've already connected to, in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file on the client machine (there's also a system-wide file /etc/ssh/known_hosts). The first time you connect to a server, you need to check by some other means that the public key presented by the server is really the public key of the server you wanted to connect to. If you have the public key of the server you're about to connect to, you can add it to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on the client manually.

Both parties negotiate a session key using a version of something called the *Diffie-Hellman algorithm*. This algorithm make it possible for each party to combine their own private data with public data from the other system to arrive at an identical secret session key. The session key will be used to encrypt the entire session.

*Note*: This stage will need to use publick key and private key to complete, __the public and private key pairs used for this part are completely separate from the SSH keys used to authenticate a client to the server.__

*The basis of this Diffie-Hellman algorithm is*:
1. Both parties agree on a large prime number, which will serve as a seed value, they also agree on an encryption generator (typically AES).
2. Each party comes up with another prime number which is kept secret from the other party. This number is used as the private key for this interaction.
3. The generated private key, the encryption generator, and the shared prime number are used to generate a public key that is derived from the private key, which can be shared with the other party.
4. Both participants then exchange their generated public keys.
5. Both participants use their own private key, the other party’s public key, and the original shared prime number to compute a shared secret key, it will result in the same shared secret key.
6. The generated secret is a symmetric key, the shared secret is then used to encrypt all communication that follows.

The above process prevents one end from controlling the secret. It also accomplishes the task of generating an identical shared secret without ever having to send that information over insecure channels.


**Second stage: Authenticating the User’s Access to the Server**
The simplest way is password authentication, and the recommended alternative is the use of SSH key pairs.

Authentication using SSH key pairs begins after the symmetric encryption has been established as described in the last section. The procedure happens like this:
1. The client begins by sending an ID for the key pair it would like to authenticate with to the server.
2. The server check’s the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the account that the client is attempting to log into for the key ID.
3. If a public key with matching ID is found in the file, the server generates a random number and uses the public key to encrypt the number.
4. The server sends the client this encrypted message.
5. If the client actually has the associated private key, it will be able to decrypt the message using that key, revealing the original number.
6. The client combines the decrypted number with the shared session key that is being used to encrypt the communication, and calculates the MD5 hash of this value.
7. The client then sends this MD5 hash back to the server as an answer to the encrypted number message.
8. The server uses the same shared session key and the original number that it sent to the client to calculate the MD5 value on its own. It compares its own calculation to the one that the client sent back. If these two values match, it proves that the client was in possession of the private key and the client is authenticated.

### ssh commands
```
$ ssh user@host [-p port -l username]
```
-   `user` 是你在远程机器上的用户名，如果不指定的话默认为当前用户, you can specify it with `-l` option
-   `host` 是远程机器的地址，可以是 IP，域名，或者是后面会提到的别名
-   `port` 是 SSH Server 监听的端口，如果不指定的话就为默认值 22


### using password
`known_hosts` 文件记录了远程主机 ip 和远程主机对应的公钥指纹。我们在第一次登陆（密码或秘钥登陆）服务器时，会有如下的提示界面：
```
$ ssh user@host [-p port -l username]
The authenticity of host 'host (12.18.429.21)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 98:2e:d7:e0:de:9f:ac:67:28:c2:42:2d:37:16:58:4d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
此时 `known_hosts` 并没有这台机器的指纹信息，只知道它的公钥指纹(MD5 HASH fingerprint)，远程主机必须在自己的网站上贴出公钥指纹，以便用户自行核对。

接受这个远程主机的公钥:
```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

系统会出现一句提示，表示host主机已经得到认可:
```
Warning: Permanently added 'host,12.18.429.21' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

然后要求输入密码:
```
Password: (enter password)
```
当远程主机的公钥被接受以后，它就会被保存在文件`~/.ssh/known_hosts`之中。下次再连接这台主机，系统就会认出它的公钥已经保存在本地了，从而跳过警告部分，直接提示输入密码。


### using public key
用户将自己的公钥储存在远程主机上，登录的时候远程主机会向用户发送一段随机字符串，用户用私钥加密后再发回来。远程主机用事先储存的公钥进行解密，如果成功，就证明用户是可信的，直接允许登录shell，不再要求密码。这种方法要求用户必须提供自己的公钥。

生成公钥密钥:
```
local$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:47VkvSjlFhKRgz/6RYdXM2EULtk9TQ65PDWJjYC5Jys user@local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|       ...o...X+o|
|      . o+   B=Oo|
|       .....ooo*=|
|        o+ooo.+ .|
|       .SoXo.  . |
|      .E X.+ .   |
|       .+.= .    |
|        .o       |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
这段话告诉我们生成的公钥放在 `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`，私钥放在  `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

运行结束以后，在`$HOME/.ssh/`目录下，会新生成两个文件：`id_rsa.pub`和`id_rsa`。前者是你的公钥，后者是你的私钥。
这时再输入下面的命令，将公钥传送到远程主机host上面：
```
local$ ssh-copy-id user@remote -p port
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
user@remote's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'user@remote' -p port"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```
从此你再登录，就不需要输入密码了。

Other SSH Commands
---
### ssh-keygen
`ssh-keygen` 是  SSH 协议套件的标准组件，用于生成，管理和转换身份验证密钥。
-  `-b` bits 指定要创建的秘钥中的位数，默认 2048 位。值越大，密码越复杂
-  `-C` comment 注释，在 id\_rsa.pub 中末尾
-  `-t` rsa/dsa等 指定要创建的秘钥类型，默认为 RSA
-  `-f` filename 指定公私钥的名称，会在 `$HOME/.ssh` 目录下生产私钥 filename 和公钥 filename.pub
-  `-N` password 指定使用秘钥的密码，使得多人使用同一台机器时更安全

生成公私钥，默认文件为 `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### ssh-agent  ssh-add
`ssh-agent` 和 `ssh-add` 是 SSH 协议套件的标准组件，用于管理私钥。一般情况下我们使用不带密码的 `id_rsa` 作为我们的默认私钥，此时是没必要启动 `ssh-agent` 的。当我们碰到以下两种情况则需要它：
1.  使用不同的秘钥连接到不同的主机时，需要手动指定对应的秘钥。（ssh-agent     帮我们选择对应的秘钥进行认证）
2.  当私钥设置了密码，而我们又需要频繁的使用私钥进行认证。（ssh-agent     帮我们免去重复输入密码）

On most Linux systems, `ssh-agent` is automatically configured and run at login, and no additional actions are required to use it. 

```
# 启动代理
eval `ssh-agent` or // eval $(ssh-agent)
# 关闭代理
ssh-agent -k
# 在 ~/.bashrc 中加入以下来实现登陆自动启动 ssh-agent，退出自动 kill 掉程序
eval $(ssh-agent -s) > /dev/null
trap 'test -n "$SSH_AGENT_PID" && eval `/usr/bin/ssh-agent -k` > /dev/null' 0

# 查看代理中的私钥
ssh-add -l
# 查看代理中私钥对应的公钥
ssh-add -L
# 移除指定的私钥
ssh-add -d /path/of/key/key_name
# 移除所有的私钥
ssh-add -D
```
`eval $(ssh-agent)` , `$(ssh-agent)` will execute `ssh-agent` and place the output at this position, the outut is like:
```
shadur@proteus:~$ ssh-agent
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-492P67qzMeGA/agent.7948; export SSH_AUTH_SOCK;
SSH_AGENT_PID=7949; export SSH_AGENT_PID;
echo Agent pid 7949;
```
the output includes some bash commmands and we then call  `eval` to execute this output.


Other usage
---
### Alias
每次都输入 `ssh user@remote -p port`，时间久了也会觉得很麻烦，特别是当user, remote 和 port 都得输入，而且还不好记忆的时候。配置别名可以让我们进一步偷懒。

比如我想用 ssh lab 来替代上面这么一长串，那么在 `~/.ssh/config` (per user) or `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (system wide) 里面追加以下内容：
```
Host lab
    HostName remote
    User user
    Port port
```
保存之后，即可用 `ssh lab` 登入，如果还配置了公钥登入，那就连密码都不用输入了。

### File transfer
在两台机之间传输文件可以用 `scp`, 它的地址格式与 ssh 基本相同，都是可以省略用户名和端口，稍微的差别在与
__指定端口时用的是大写的 -P 而不是小写的__


To copy all from **Local Location** to **Remote Location** (Upload)
``` sh
scp -r =P/path/from/destination username@hostname:/path/to/destination
```

To copy all from **Remote Location** to **Local Location** (Download)
``` sh
scp -r -P 12423 xiami@unicom-01.home.co:/home/downloads/ /home/downloads/downloads
```

Custom Port where `xxxx` is **custom port** number
``` lang-sh
 scp -r -P xxxx username@hostname:/path/from/destination /path/to/destination
```

Copy on current directory from **Remote to Local**
``` lang-sh
scp -r username@hostname:/path/from/file .
```

**Help:**

1.  `-r` Recursively copy all directories and files
2.  Always use full location from `/`, Get full location by `pwd`
3.  `scp` will replace all existing files
4.  `hostname` will be hostname or IP address
5.  if custom port is needed (besides port 22) use `-P portnumber`
6.  **. (dot)** - it means current working directory, So download/copy from server and paste here only.

**Note:** Sometimes the custom port will not work due to the port not being allowed in the firewall, so make sure that custom port is allowed in the firewall for incoming and outgoing connection

### Executing remote commands
The ssh command is often also used to remotely execute commands on the remote machine without logging in to a shell prompt. The syntax for this is:

```sh
ssh hostname command

ssh sample.ssh.com  ls /tmp/doc
```

After authenticating to the remote server, the contents of the remote directory will be displayed

### keep process in background
一旦 ssh 进程退出，所有它之前启动的程序都会被杀死。你需要在远程的机子上使用 tmux。tmux 是一个会话管理程序，他会保持程序一直运行着。
