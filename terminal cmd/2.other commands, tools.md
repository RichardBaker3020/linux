## System managment
### systemctl

**manage daemon** :  

* `systemctl [command] [unit]`
	command 有:

| command   | explanation                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| start     |                                  |
| stop      |                                  |
| restart   |                                  |
| reload    | reload the config                |
| enable    | run on boot                      |
| disable   |                                  |
| status    |                                  |
| is-active |                                  |

不应该使用 kill 的方式来关掉一个正常的服务否则 systemctl 会无法继续监控该服务, use stop command instead.

**list all service(.service, .target)**:  
* `systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled` :will list all enabled service that will run on boot.
	* `systemctl | grep running`

* `systemctl [command] [--type=TYPE] [--all]`
	command:
	1. `list-units`:依据 unit 列出目前有启动的 unit。
	2. `list-unit-files` :依据 /usr/lib/systemd/system/ 内的文件,将所有文件列表说明。
	4. 若加上 `--all` 会列出没启动的。
    3. --type, 主要有 service, socket, target 等

**target unit**:  
 multi-user.target: 纯文本模式
 graphical.target: 图形界面

* `systemctl get-default` : to check the default mode, text-mode or graphical
* `systemctl set-default multi-user.target` : set text-mode as default
* `systemctl isolate multi-user.target` : quit graphical interface and into text-mode(sigh out)
* `systemctl isolate graphical.target` : re-enter graph
	* 在 target 项目则请使用 isolate (隔离不同的操作模式) 

* `systemctl poweroff/reboot/suspend/hibernate/rescue/emergency` 
	* above cmd could be alternates to `isolate shutdown.target|rescue.target ...` 

**daemon tree**:  
* `systemctl list-dependencies [unit] [--reverse]`
	* reverse这个选项,代表“谁还会用到我的服务”的意思
	* without [unit] option means default.target(e.g. graphical.target)

e.g.
```
[root@study ~]# systemctl list-dependencies --reverse
default.target
└─graphical.target
```


### wget
wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, aser well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.
```
'wget http://website.com/files/file.zip' : download the file from web
'wget www.pincong.rocks' :download html into index.html file
'wget url -O <filename> : download the file and change its name
'wget -o download.log url' : log output to a file
'wget -r url' : download a html page and all its links' htmls. (use -l option to specify the recursion level)

```
dir函数，显示对象所有可用方法。函数参数可以是任何object，可以是任意string , int , list. 获取相应的方法后，可以用help()函数获取其使用方法。

## System Performance, Monitoring
### top
The top command shows you a real-time display of the data relating to your Linux machine. 

1. The first line shows you the time and how long your computer has been running for, how many users are logged into it, and what the load average has been.

2. The second line shows the number of tasks and their states: running, stopped, sleeping and zombie.

3. The third line shows CPU information. Here’s what the fields mean:

- us: value is the CPU time the CPU spends executing processes for users, in “user space”
- sy: value is the CPU time spent on running system “kernel space” processes
- ni: value is the CPU time spent on executing processes with a manually set nice value
- id: is the amount of CPU idle time
- wa: value is the time the CPU spends waiting for I/O to complete
- hi: The CPU time spent servicing hardware interrupts
- si: The CPU time spent servicing software interrupts
- st: The CPU time lost due to running virtual machines (“steal time”)

4. The fourth line shows the total amount of physical memory, and how much is free, used and buffered or cached.

5. The fifth line shows the total amount of swap memory, and how much is free, used and available  (taking into account memory that is expected to be recoverable from caches).

6. the task area
`PID` This is the process ID, a unique positive integer that identifies a process.  
`USER` This is the “effective” username (which maps to a user ID) of the user who started the process. Linux assigns a real user ID and an effective user ID to processes; the latter allows a process to act on behalf of another user. (For example, a non-root user can elevate to root in order to install a package.)  
`PR` and `NI` The “NI” field shows the “nice” value of a process. The “PR” field shows the scheduling priority of the process from the perspective of the kernel. The nice value affects the priority of a process.  
`VIRT`, `RES`, `SHR` and %`MEM` These three fields are related with to memory consumption of the processes. “VIRT” is the total amount of memory consumed by a process. This includes the program’s code, the data stored by the process in memory, as well as any regions of memory that have been swapped to the disk. “RES” is the memory consumed by the process in RAM, and “%MEM” expresses this value as a percentage of the total RAM available. Finally, “SHR” is the amount of memory shared with other processes.  
`TIME+` This is the total CPU time used by the process since it started, precise to the hundredths of a second.

6. command
 * pressed the `E/e` key to change the display into more humanly digestible figures instead of long integers representing bytes.
* you want to kill a process, simply press `k` when top is running
* Sorting the process list
    * `‘M’` to sort by memory usage
    * `‘P’` to sort by CPU usage
    * `‘N’` to sort by process ID
    * `‘T’` to sort by the running time
    * `F` to sort bt other field.
    * you can switch to ascending order by pressing `‘R’`.
* Press `‘c’`  to show the full path to the program

6. Saving your settings
If you’ve made any changes to top’s output, you can save them for later use by pressing `‘W’`. top writes its configuration to the .toprc file in your home directory.

## Network Management
### Firewalld

https://wangchujiang.com/linux-command/c/firewall-cmd.html  
If you’ve got a web server like nginx running on your machine, you can confirm that the firewall is working by browsing to your server’s web from your phone. If the site is unreachable, then firewalld is doing its job.  
By default, firewalld will be active and will reject all incoming traffic with a couple of exceptions like SSH,  you’ll want to open the HTTP(80) and HTTPS(443) ports respectively.

**状态选项**
```
firewall-cmd --state                # 显示firewalld的状态；
--reload                       # 不中断服务的重新加载；
--complete-reload              # 中断所有连接的重新加载；
--runtime-to-permanent         # 将当前防火墙的规则永久保存；
--check-config                 # 检查配置正确性；
```

**端口管理**
```
# 打开443/TCP端口
firewall-cmd --add-port=443/tcp

# 永久打开3690/TCP端口
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3690/tcp

# 永久打开端口好像需要reload一下，临时打开好像不用，如果用了reload临时打开的端口就失效了
# 其它服务也可能是这样的，这个没有测试
firewall-cmd --reload

# 查看开放的端口
firewall-cmd --list-ports               

# 查看防火墙，添加的端口也可以看到
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

**控制端口 / 服务**  
可以通过两种方式控制端口的开放，一种是指定端口号另一种是指定服务名。虽然开放 http 服务就是开放了 80 端口，但是还是不能通过端口号来关闭，也就是说通过指定服务名开放的就要通过指定服务名关闭；通过指定端口号开放的就要通过指定端口号关闭。
```
firewall-cmd --add-service=mysql        # 开放mysql端口
firewall-cmd --remove-service=http      # 阻止http端口
firewall-cmd --list-services            # 查看开放的服务
firewall-cmd --add-port=3306/tcp        # 开放通过tcp访问3306
firewall-cmd --remove-port=80tcp        # 阻止通过tcp访问3306
firewall-cmd --add-port=233/udp         # 开放通过udp访问233
```

**日志管理**
```
firewall-cmd --get-log-denied         # 获取日志记录设置
firewall-cmd --set-log-denied=<value> # 设置拒绝记录日志， 'all','unicast','broadcast','multicast','off'

dmesg | grep -i REJECT    # view denied packets
```

### netstat

[detailed tutorial](https://www.howtogeek.com/513003/how-to-use-netstat-on-linux/)

> socket
Sockets have two main states: They are either connected and facilitating an ongoing network communication, or they are waiting for an incoming connection to connect to them. 
The listening socket is called the server, and the socket that requests a connection with the listening socket is called a client.These names have nothing to do with hardware or computer roles. They simply define the role of each socket at each end of the connection.

The `netstat` command lets you discover which sockets are connected and which sockets are listening. Meaning, it tells you which ports are in use and which processes are using them. It can show you routing tables and statistics about your network interfaces and multicast connections.

1. `netstat -a` The -a (all) option makes netstat show all the connected and waiting sockets. 
**output**:

```
    Active Internet connections (servers and established)
    |Proto |Recv-Q |Send-Q |Local Address     |Foreign Address     |State |
    |tcp   |    0      0     localhost:domain      0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN 
    |tcp   |    0      0     0.0.0.0:ssh           0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN 
    |tcp   |    0      0     localhost:ipp         0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN 
    |tcp   |    0      0     localhost:smtp        0.0.0.0:*        LISTEN 
    |tcp6  |    0      0     [::]:ssh              [::]:*           LISTEN 
    |tcp6  |    0      0     ip6-localhost:ipp     [::]:*           LISTEN 
```
```
    Active UNIX domain sockets (servers and established)
    Proto RefCnt Flags   Type     State       I-Node  Path
    unix  24     [ ]     DGRAM                12831   /run/systemd/journal/dev-log
    unix  2      [ ACC ] STREAM    LISTENING  24747   @/tmp/dbus-zH6clYmvw8
    unix  2      [ ]     DGRAM                26372   /run/user/1000/systemd/notify
    unix  2      [ ]     DGRAM                23382   /run/user/121/systemd/notify
    unix  2      [ ACC ] SEQPACKET LISTENING  12839   /run/udev/control
```
The “Active Internet” section lists the connected external connections and local sockets listening for remote connection requests. That is, it lists the network connections that are (or will be) established to external devices.

The “Active Internet” columns are:  
**Proto**: The protocol used by this socket (for example, TCP or UDP).  
**Recv-Q**: The receive queue. These are incoming bytes that have been received and are buffered, waiting for the *local process* that is using this connection to read and consume them.  
**Send-Q**: The send queue. This shows the bytes that are ready to be sent from the send queue.  
**Local address**: The address details of the local end of the connection. The default is for netstat to show the *local hostname* for the address, and the name of the service for the port.  
**Foreign address**: The address and port number of the remote end of the connection.  
**State**: The state of the local socket. For UDP sockets, this is usually blank.(check out tcp notes in onenote)


The “UNIX domain” section lists the connected and listening internal connections. In other words, it lists the connections that have been established within your computer between different applications, processes, and elements of the operating system.

2. `netstat -au | less` -u option means show only udp, you can also use -t option to show tcp
3. `netstat -s` -s shows Network Statistics , use -t or other option to show result by Protocol
4. `netstat -p` -p shows process id with socket.
5. `netstat -tulpn` find out which process is listing upon a port

### nmap
然后扫描本地端口
```
~ nmap localhost
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-08 01:08 CST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0018s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
8022/tcp open  oa-system
8080/tcp open  http-proxy
```

### curl
to retrieve content with url  
`-o` option download content to file: `curl url -o filename`  
`-I, --head `  Show document info only  
`-v, --verbose` talkative

### test

test is used as part of the conditional execution of shell commands.
test exits with the status code determined by EXPRESSION. 
To see the exit status,type `echo $?`, A value of 0 means the expression evaluated as true, and a value of 1 means the expression evaluated as false.

two form:
1. test EXPRESSION
2. [ EXPRESSION ]

`test 100 -lt 99 && echo "Yes." || echo "No."`
or `[ 100 -lt 99 ] && echo "Yes." || echo "No."`

```
patrick@surface:$ [ 100 -eq 22 ]
patrick@surface:$ echo $?
1
```
[detailed usage](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/test.htm)


### printf

printf 由 POSIX 标准所定义，因此使用 printf 的脚本比使用 echo 移植性好。

printf 使用引用文本或空格分隔的参数，外面可以在 printf 中使用格式化字符串，还可以制定字符串的宽度、左右对齐方式等。
> 默认 printf 不会像 echo 自动添加换行符，我们可以手动添加 \n。

e.g.
```
printf "%-10s %-8s %-4s\n" 姓名 性别 体重kg  
printf "%-10s %-8s %-4.2f\n" 郭靖 男 66.1234 
printf "%-10s %-8s %-4.2f\n" 杨过 男 48.6543 
printf "%-10s %-8s %-4.2f\n" 郭芙 女 47.9876 
```

output:
```
姓名     性别   体重kg
郭靖     男      66.12
杨过     男      48.65
郭芙     女      47.99
```

[detailed tutorial](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uprintf.htm)


### hexdump
`hexdump` has the ability to dump file contents into many formats like hexadecimal, octal, ASCII and decimal. This command takes a file, or any standard input, as input parameter and converts it to the format of your choice. 


`hexdump -b`  
This option is also called "__One-byte octal display__".  The output will be followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, zero-filled, bytes of input data, in octal, per line. 

`hexdump -c`  
This option is referred to as "__One-byte ASCII character display__".  will dispaly bits in ASCII character format.

`hexdump -C`  
Also known as "hex+ASCII display", will display bytes in both hex and ASCII character format:
```
patrick@surface:~$ hexdump -C -n 100 ./Downloads/16.png
00000000  89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a  00 00 00 0d 49 48 44 52  |.PNG........IHDR|
00000010  00 00 05 dc 00 00 04 2d  08 06 00 00 00 40 8c 8d  |.......-.....@..|
...
```
[other options](https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-hexdump-command-examples/)

you can use hexdump with other command:  
```
patrick@surface:~$ echo "this is cool" | hexdump -C -n 100
00000000  74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20  63 6f 6f 6c 0a           |this is cool.|
0000000d
```
### ip

https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-ip-command-examples-usage-syntax

`ip` command can be used for following purposes:
1. Find out which interfaces are configured on the system.
2. Query the status of a IP interface.
3. Configure the local loop-back, Ethernet and other IP interfaces.
4. Assign, delete, set up IP address, routes, subnet and other IP information to IP interfaces.
5. List IP Addresses and property information.

## ssh
### ssh-keygen
`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
* `-t` The type of key to be generated. If invoked without any arguments, ssh-keygen will generate an RSA key
* `-b` Specifies the number of bits in the key to create. For RSA keys the default is 2048 bits. 
* `-C ` Provides a new comment.

### show trusted keys
`apt-key`


## Others
hibernate

> sudo systemctl suspend
> sudo systemctl hibernate

show all cmd in bash
---
> ls /bin/

**internal command or external command**  
`whereis <cmd>` , if the corresponding path is shown for a specified command, this command is a external command, or otherwise.

> 通俗地说，“内部命令”就是内置在 shell 中的命令；而“外部命令”则对应了某个具体的【可执行文件】。当你在 shell 中执行“外部命令”，shell 会启动对应的可执行文件，从而创建出一个“子进程”；而如果是“内部命令”，就【不】产生子进程。


unzip .zip file

`xdg-open file`



environment var 
---
[link](note://environment_variables)

* env

allow you to run another program in a another environment without influencing the current one.
run without parameter, will print all environment variables.

* `printenv`
* `printenv HOME`
* `printenv LANG PWD`: print env variables

* set

set  **shell** variables
use without option, `set `show a list of env, shell and variables without parameter
> to create shell variables: `var='sgjgdks'`

* unset

delete shell and env variables

* export

In general, the export command marks an environment variable to be exported with any newly forked child processes and thus it allows a child process to inherit all marked variables. 
detailed instructions [export - LinuxConfig.org](https://linuxconfig.org/learning-linux-commands-export)

use **export** to set temporary environment variable:
`export MYVAR=10`
`export PATH=$PATH:/home/patrick/clash` or `export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)`(set env for current dir)
and then you can run executable by command in specified directory.

__Persistent Environment Variables__
```
To make Environment variables persistent you need to define those variables in the bash configuration files. In most Linux distributions when you start a new session, environment variables are read from the following files:

1. /etc/environment - Use this file to set up system-wide environment variables. Variables in this file are set in the following format:
FOO=bar
VAR_TEST="Test Var"

2. /etc/profile - Variables set in this file are loaded whenever a bash login shell is entered. When declaring environment variables in this file you need to use the export command:
export JAVA_HOME="/path/to/java/home"
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

3. Per-user shell specific configuration files. For example, if you are using Bash, you can declare the variables in the ~/.bashrc:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

To load the new environment variables into the current shell session use the source command:
source ~/.bashrc
```


network interface
---
1. `ifconfig` allows for diagnosing and configuring network interfaces.
[detailed explanation](https://goinbigdata.com/demystifying-ifconfig-and-network-interfaces-in-linux/)
2. `tcpdump -D` can also show list of available interfaces
3. `ip a` aslo shows interfaces and their IP address

A new naming scheme(`wlp2s0`) has been introduced, rather than (`eth0`, `wlan0`) naming standards.
Basically, the first two letter describe the type of interface. `wl` for wlan, `en` for ethernet. The following code is often a description of the physical placement of the device in your computer - `p2` is likely PCI bus 2, and `s0` is likely slot 0.
* `wlp2s0` is your wifi interface. `en` is your Ethernet interface. `lo` is your loopback interface.

Linux kernel distinguishes between two types of network interfaces: *physical* and *virtual*. 
* *Physical network* interface represents an actual network hardware device such as network interface controller (NIC). 
* *Virtual network* interface doesn’t represent any hardware device and is usually linked to one. There are different kinds of virtual interfaces: Loopback, bridges, VLANs, tunnel interfaces and so on.
