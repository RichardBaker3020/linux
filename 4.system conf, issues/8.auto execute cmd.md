Run before shutdown
---
 On Ubuntu, scripts for the different runlevels are executed according to their presence in the `/etc/rc[0-6].d` directories. Runlevel *0* corresponds to shutdown, and *6* to reboot.

You can write your script, store it in `/etc/init.d/`, then create a symlink in each of /etc/rc0.d and /etc/rc6.d (if you want both) pointing to your script.

 The scripts in each runlevel directory will be executed in asciibetical order, so if the order within the runlevel matters to you, choose the name of your symlink accordingly.

To execute a script at shutdown or reboot:
1.  save your script in `/etc/rc6.d`
2.  Make it executable: `sudo chmod +x K99_script`

Notes:
-   The script in rc6.d must be with no .sh extension
-   The name of your script must begin with K99 to run at the right time.
-   The scripts in this directory are executed in alphabetical order.

1.  Create a shell executable file with your script in `/etc/init.d/` directory.

2.  Since this has to be executed during shutdown or reboot need to create softlinks in `/etc/rc0.d/` and `/etc/rc6.d`

Example:
```sh
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/<your_file> /etc/rc0.d/k99stop_vm
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/<your_file> /etc/rc6.d/k99stop_vm
sudo chmod a+x /etc/init.d/<your_file>
```
