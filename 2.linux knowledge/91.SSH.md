SSH
---
SSH 分为客户端和服务端。  
服务端是一个守护进程，一般是 *sshd* 进程，在后台运行并响应来自客户端的请求。提供了对远程请求的处理，一般包括公共密钥认证、密钥交换、对称密钥加密和非安全连接。 客户端一般是 *ssh* 进程，另外还包含 scp、slogin、sftp 等其他进程。

### sshd
Install ssh server: `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`

开启 sshd：
```
$ systemctl start sshd.service #启动
$ systemctl stop sshd.service #停止
$ systemctl restart sshd.service #重启 
```

sshd 配置文件：`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
``` 
Port 22    // default is 22

RSAAuthentication yes 
pubkeyAuthentication yes

AuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys

PasswordAuthentication no        // whether allow connection with password
```

The `authorized_keys` file lets the server authenticate the user.

### How Does SSH Work
An SSH session is established in *two separate stages*.  
1. The first is to agree upon and establish encryption to protect future communication.  
2. The second stage is to authenticate the user and discover whether access to the server should be granted.

**first stage**  
When a TCP connection is made by a client, the server responds with the protocol versions it supports. __The server also provides its public host key__, which the client can use to check whether this was the intended host.

Both parties negotiate a session key using a version of something called the *Diffie-Hellman algorithm*. This algorithm make it possible for each party to combine their own private data with public data from the other system to arrive at an identical secret session key. The session key will be used to encrypt the entire session.

*Note*: This stage will need to use publick key and private key to complete, __the public and private key pairs used for this part are completely separate from the SSH keys used to authenticate a client to the server.__

*The basis of this procedure is*:
1. Both parties agree on a large prime number, which will serve as a seed value, they also agree on an encryption generator (typically AES).
2. Each party comes up with another prime number which is kept secret from the other party. This number is used as the private key for this interaction.
3. The generated private key, the encryption generator, and the shared prime number are used to generate a public key that is derived from the private key, which can be shared with the other party.
4. Both participants then exchange their generated public keys.
5. Both participants use their own private key, the other party’s public key, and the original shared prime number to compute a shared secret key, it will result in the same shared secret key.
6. The generated secret is a symmetric key,The shared secret is then used to encrypt all communication that follows.

The above process does not allow one end to control the secret. It also accomplishes the task of generating an identical shared secret without ever having to send that information over insecure channels.

Connect remote machine
---
```
$ ssh user@host [-p port -l username]
```
-   `user` 是你在远程机器上的用户名，如果不指定的话默认为当前用户, you can specify it with `-l` option
-   `host` 是远程机器的地址，可以是 IP，域名，或者是后面会提到的别名
-   `port` 是 SSH Server 监听的端口，如果不指定的话就为默认值 22


### using password
第一次登录对方主机会出现下面的提示：
```
$ ssh user@host [-p port -l username]
The authenticity of host 'host (12.18.429.21)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 98:2e:d7:e0:de:9f:ac:67:28:c2:42:2d:37:16:58:4d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
无法确认host主机的真实性，只知道它的公钥指纹(MD5 HASH fingerprint)，问你还想继续连接吗？ 怎么知道远程主机的公钥指纹应该是多少？ 没有好办法，远程主机必须在自己的网站上贴出公钥指纹，以便用户自行核对。

接受这个远程主机的公钥:
```
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

系统会出现一句提示，表示host主机已经得到认可:
```
Warning: Permanently added 'host,12.18.429.21' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
```

然后要求输入密码:
```
Password: (enter password)
```
当远程主机的公钥被接受以后，它就会被保存在文件`~/.ssh/known_hosts`之中。下次再连接这台主机，系统就会认出它的公钥已经保存在本地了，从而跳过警告部分，直接提示输入密码。


### using public key
用户将自己的公钥储存在远程主机上，登录的时候远程主机会向用户发送一段随机字符串，用户用私钥加密后再发回来。远程主机用事先储存的公钥进行解密，如果成功，就证明用户是可信的，直接允许登录shell，不再要求密码。这种方法要求用户必须提供自己的公钥。

生成公钥密钥:
```
local$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:47VkvSjlFhKRgz/6RYdXM2EULtk9TQ65PDWJjYC5Jys user@local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|       ...o...X+o|
|      . o+   B=Oo|
|       .....ooo*=|
|        o+ooo.+ .|
|       .SoXo.  . |
|      .E X.+ .   |
|       .+.= .    |
|        .o       |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```
这段话告诉我们生成的公钥放在 `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`，私钥放在  `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

运行结束以后，在$HOME/.ssh/目录下，会新生成两个文件：id_rsa.pub和id_rsa。前者是你的公钥，后者是你的私钥。
这时再输入下面的命令，将公钥传送到远程主机host上面：

`    $ ssh-copy-id user@host`

好了，从此你再登录，就不需要输入密码了。

**authorized_keys文件**
远程主机将用户的公钥，保存在登录后的用户主目录的$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys文件中

Other usage

### Executing remote commands on the server

The ssh command is often also used to remotely execute commands on the remote machine without logging in to a shell prompt. The syntax for this is:

    `ssh hostname command`
e.g.

    `ssh sample.ssh.com  ls /tmp/doc`

After authenticating to the remote server, the contents of the remote directory will be displayed

### port forwarding

1. local forwarding
2. remote forwarding

### Connection refused
```
local$ ssh user@remote -p port 
ssh: connect to host remote port 22: Connection refused
```
说明在 远程机器 上没有安装 SSH Server, 执行下面命令安装： `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`
