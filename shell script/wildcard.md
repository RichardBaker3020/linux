three main wildcard characters
---
The three main wildcard characters are,

Star or Asterisk (`*`)
Question mark (`?`)
Square brackets (`[]`)

Asterisk (*) is used to search for particular character(s) for zero or more times. Question mark (?) is used to search for a fixed number of characters where each question mark (?) indicates each character. Square brackets are used to match with the characters of a defined range or a group of characters. The uses of these characters are shown in the next part of this tutorial.
